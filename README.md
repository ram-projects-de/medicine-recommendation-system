# Medicine Recommendation System using NLP

This project was developed as part of **Healthcare Analytics (Winter 2024)** to address the complexity of selecting alternate medicines in the Indian pharmaceutical market. The system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and similarity-based modeling to recommend effective drug alternatives, helping optimize pharmaceutical care.

## 📊 Project Overview
- Built a **Medicine Recommendation System** to suggest alternative drugs based on composition, type, price, and manufacturer.
- Used a **Kaggle dataset** with over **250,000 medicine records** and 7,600+ manufacturers.
- Implemented **Cosine Similarity** and weighted feature scoring for accurate recommendations.
- Developed an interactive **Flask-based web app** for real-time recommendations.
- Designed **Power BI dashboards** to visualize price trends, manufacturer distributions, and medicine categories.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and structured large-scale pharmaceutical data.  
- **NLP-based Modeling**: Extracted and compared medicine compositions using embeddings.  
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggested alternate medicines using similarity scores.  
- **Data Visualization**: Highlighted cost patterns and medicine availability through dashboards.  
- **Deployment**: Flask app for user-friendly access to recommendations.

## 📈 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, gensim, sklearn, NLP libraries)  
- **Flask** for deployment  
- **Power BI** for dashboards and insights  
- **Excel** for initial data cleaning
